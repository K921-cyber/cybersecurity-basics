## 🧩 Core Concepts  

### 🔺 CIA Triad  
- 🔒 **Confidentiality** → Only authorized users can access data.  
- ✏️ **Integrity** → Data remains accurate and unchanged.  
- ⚡ **Availability** → Systems are up and accessible when needed.  

### 👤 Authentication vs. Authorization  
- 🔑 **Authentication** → *Who you are* (password, OTP, biometrics).  
- ✅ **Authorization** → *What you can do* (permissions after login).  

---

| Threat | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| 🦠 **Malware** | Malicious software | Virus, Worms, Trojans |
| 🎣 **Phishing** | Fake messages/websites to steal data | Email scams |
| 💀 **DoS/DDoS** | Overloading a system to make it crash | Flooding a server |
| 🕵️ **Insider Threats** | Attacks from within the org | Employee misuse |

---

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices  

✔️ Use **strong & unique passwords**  
✔️ Enable **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)**  
✔️ Keep **software updated**  
✔️ Avoid **suspicious links/websites**  
✔️ Always **backup important data**  

---

## 🌍 Real-World Example  

🏦 **Bank Website Security**  
- 🔒 Confidentiality → Only account owner sees balance
