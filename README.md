## 🎯 Core Concepts: The CIA Triad

Cybersecurity is built on three core principles. Think of them as the pillars of your digital fortress.

| Principle | Description | Simple Analogy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Confidentiality** 🤫 | Ensuring information is only accessible to those authorized to see it. | A locked diary. Only you have the key. |
| **Integrity** 🔐 | Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of data. Protecting it from unauthorized modification. | A signed, sealed legal document. You know it hasn't been tampered with. |
| **Availability** ✅ | Ensuring that information and systems are accessible to authorized users when needed. | The lights are on and the doors are open when you need to get in. |

## ⚠️ Common Threats: The Enemy's Arsenal

Understanding your enemy is the first step to defense.

| Threat | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Malware** 🐛 | Malicious software designed to harm or exploit. Includes viruses, worms, ransomware, and spyware. |
| **Phishing** 🎣 | Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity. |
| **Social Engineering** 🕵️ | Manipulating people into divulging confidential information. Phishing is a form of this. |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** 👂 | An attacker secretly intercepts and relays messages between two parties who believe they are communicating directly. |
| **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** 💥 | Overwhelming a system or network with traffic to make it unavailable to its intended users. |
| **SQL Injection** 💉 | An attacker inserts malicious SQL code into a database query to view, modify, or delete data. |
| **Zero-Day Exploit** 💣 | An attack that exploits a previously unknown vulnerability in software or hardware. |

## 🛡️ Defensive Strategies: Your Digital Hygiene

This is the most important section. These are practical, actionable steps you can take *right now*.

### 🔑 Passwords & Authentication

- **Use a Password Manager:** Stop reusing passwords! A password manager generates and stores strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.
  - *Recommendations:* [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), [1Password](https://1password.com/), [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/).

- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** This is the **single most effective** security control you can implement. It requires a second form of verification (e.g., a code from an app or a fingerprint) in addition to your password. **Turn it on everywhere.**

### 🔄 Software & System Updates

- **Keep Everything Updated:** Regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and all applications. Updates often contain critical security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities.

- **Enable Automatic Updates:** Where possible, enable automatic updates to ensure you're always protected.

### 🎣 Phishing & Social Engineering

- **Be Skeptical:** Question unsolicited emails, messages, and phone calls. Check the sender's email address, look for poor grammar, and hover over links to see the actual URL.

- **Verify Requests:** If you receive an urgent request for money or information, verify it through a separate, known communication channel (e.g., call the person back).

- **Don't Click & Tell:** Never download files or click links from unknown or suspicious sources.

### 🌐 Network Security

- **Use a VPN on Public Wi-Fi:** A Virtual Private Network (VPN) encrypts your internet traffic, protecting your data from others on the same network.

- **Secure Your Home Wi-Fi:** Change your router's default password, use WPA3 encryption, and disable WPS if possible.

### 💾 Backups & Recovery

- **Follow the 3-2-1 Rule:**
  - **3** copies of your data.
  - **2** different storage media (e.g., external hard drive and cloud storage).
  - **1** copy stored off-site (e.g., in the cloud or at a different physical location).

- **Test Your Backups:** Periodically test your backups to ensure you can restore your data in an emergency.
