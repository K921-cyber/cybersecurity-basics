## 🚀 Introduction

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks, programs, and data from unauthorized access or attacks. These attacks can lead to data theft, financial loss, or disruption of services.

**Why cybersecurity matters:**

- 🕵️‍♂️ Protect your personal data  
- 💳 Secure financial transactions  
- 🏛️ Safeguard national security  
- 🏢 Ensure business continuity  
- 🔒 Preserve privacy and trust

## 🛡️ Core Principles

The backbone of cybersecurity is built on these pillars:

| Principle       | Description                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Only authorized users can access information. |
| **Integrity**       | Data remains accurate and unaltered.          |
| **Availability**    | Systems and data are accessible when needed.  |
| **Authentication**  | Verifying user or system identity.             |
| **Authorization**   | Granting permissions based on identity.       |
